# Advent of Code - TypeScript

## Setup

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Structure

- `src/2025/` - Solutions for 2025 (create additional year folders as needed)
- Create your solution files as `src/2025/day1.ts`, `src/2025/day2.ts`, etc.
- Store input files as `src/2025/day1.input.txt`, etc.

## Running Solutions

Run a specific day's solution:
```bash
npm run day --year=2025 --day=1
```

Or use ts-node directly:
```bash
npx ts-node src/2025/day1.ts
```

## Building

Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:
```bash
npm run build
```
